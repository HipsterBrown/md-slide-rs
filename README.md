# md-slide

A markdown to slide generator CLI

Built in Rust using [structopt](https://lib.rs/crates/structopt) and [pulldown-cmark](https://lib.rs/crates/pulldown-cmark).

## Motivation

I enjoy writing my presentations in Markdown and wanted to be able generate the slides from that content. After trying [`mdx-deck`](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck), [`marp`](https://marp.app), and [`remark`](https://github.com/gnab/remark), I wanted something a bit simpler for my workflow of writing in vim then presenting pretty basic slides from those notes. The tools I mentioned are great for flexibility and powerful layouts that I don't normally need.
